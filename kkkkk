Has anyone encountered this issue?

We are running an ALTER PDS statement, and while it mostly succeeds, about one in every ten to fifteen executions fails with the same error: “invalid Parquet footer” for a specific file. However, this file exists in the MinIO bucket, and its last modified date in MinIO is from last November, meaning it hasn’t changed for over two months.

But in the past few days, in our stage environment, this issue has been happening intermittently. Could this be due to inconsistent caching across MinIO nodes, or is it a caching issue on the Dremio executor cluster?

Just throwing this out to the team—has anyone seen this before or know how to fix it?
