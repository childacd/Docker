Revised Content (Simplified):

Kim has earned trust by addressing important challenges such as setting up the Compute Environment for the SFT team, which improved accessibility and support for internal teams. SFT (Securities Financing Transactions) is a system that helps calculate the firm’s exposure to counterparties, critical for managing risk.

Additionally, Kim’s integration of OPA (Open Policy Agent), a policy engine for enforcing governance rules, into provision pipelines ensured compliance and streamlined resource management. These contributions demonstrate Kim’s reliability in both technical and collaborative efforts.

调整说明：
	1.	对SFT和OPA的功能高度概括，仅保留关键点（风险管理、治理规则）。
	2.	用简单语言嵌入背景说明，保持内容流畅和简洁。
