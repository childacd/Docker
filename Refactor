Revised Teamwork – Collaboration Section:

Kim actively collaborates on tasks such as testing pipeline integrations and refining AWS configurations. Her teamwork during projects like the Proteus AWS deployment refactor ensured smoother operations and alignment with team objectives, strengthening overall deliverables.

The objective of the Proteus AWS deployment refactor was to optimize the increasingly redundant and complex code structure caused by layer upon layer of additions. This effort not only streamlined configurations to align with Ansible best practices but also significantly improved deployment efficiency. The result was cleaner, more maintainable code and faster, more effective usage from both a configuration and operational perspective, providing substantial benefits to the Proteus team.

整合改动说明：
	1.	保留原始回答的结构，突出 Kim 的团队协作能力。
	2.	加入领导评语的回答，具体阐述了 Proteus AWS 重构的目标和成果，并与原内容自然结合。
	3.	突出协作和优化的双重作用，既强调技术贡献，又体现对团队的价值。
