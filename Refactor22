Revised Teamwork – Collaboration Section:

Kim actively collaborates on tasks such as testing pipeline integrations and refining AWS configurations. Her teamwork during the Proteus AWS deployment refactor addressed the increasingly redundant and complex code structure caused by repeated additions over time. Through this refactor, Kim streamlined configurations to align with Ansible best practices, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. This optimization significantly improved deployment speed and efficiency, benefiting both the configuration and operational processes of the Proteus team.

改动说明：
	1.	将原答案中较宽泛的表述（如“Align with team objectives”）具体化，用优化代码结构和部署效率提升补充细节。
	2.	将领导提出的问题直接融入原段落，使其更流畅地回答了关键问题。
	3.	简化语言，去掉重复和笼统的表述，同时保留了协作的重点和技术改进的具体成果。
