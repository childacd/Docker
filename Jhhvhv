## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step instructions for Production Support to enable **S3 Bucket Key** for selected S3 buckets in the `PROD_EU (12345678)` AWS account.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the AWS Console with sufficient S3 and IAM policy editing permissions.
- List of target buckets to apply the changes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Log in to AWS Console

- Open the AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- Log in to the `PROD_EU (12345678)` account.

### 2. Navigate to the S3 Service

- In the AWS Console, go to **S3**.
- In the left navigation pane, click **Buckets**.

### 3. Check Replication Status

For each target bucket:

1. Click the bucket name.
2. Go to the **Management** tab.
3. Scroll down to **Replication rules**.
4. Determine if **replication is enabled**.

### 4. Apply Configuration Based on Replication

#### If Replication is Enabled:

- Update the **Bucket Policy** to include the bucket as an encryption context.
- Refer to the internal policy guidelines or reach out to the Security team for the correct policy JSON snippet.

#### If Replication is NOT Enabled:

- Proceed to the next step to enable the bucket key.

## 5. Enable S3 Bucket Key

For each target bucket:

1. Go to the **Properties** tab.

3. Click **Edit**.
4. Under **Bucket Key**, select **Enable**.
5. Click **Save changes**.

Repeat for all target buckets.

## Post-Change Validation

- Confirm that each bucketâ€™s **Bucket Key** shows as "Enabled".
- Verify that data uploads still succeed.
- Optionally, test replication behavior (if applicable).

## Notes

- Enabling Bucket Keys helps reduce the cost of using AWS KMS.
- Do not enable Bucket Keys for buckets with custom KMS key policies unless validated.
- Contact the Security or Cloud team if unsure about replication context policy changes.
