英文翻译：
Risk IT is undergoing a migration process from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS cloud. During this process, the corresponding infrastructure needs to be built, along with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and resource management in the cloud. These elements are essential to ensure the proper functioning of business systems and the efficient utilization of cloud resources.

Kim focuses on the design, optimization, and configuration of CI/CD pipelines within Risk IT. Working collaboratively with the team, Kim leverages AWS frameworks to monitor costs and incorporates validation mechanisms into the pipelines to manage the resources being created.

This plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of business systems.

润色后的建议：
我增加了逻辑上的连贯性和一些更专业的表述，比如“incorporates validation mechanisms”会比“加入校验”更专业一些，整体上简洁清晰地传达了技术重点和业务意义。如果有需要可以再进一步调整。
