英文翻译：
Risk IT is undergoing a migration process from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS cloud. During this process, it is essential to build the corresponding infrastructure and establish CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and resource management in the cloud. This ensures the proper operation of business systems and the efficient utilization of cloud resources.

Kim focuses on the design, optimization, and configuration of CI/CD pipelines within Risk IT. Collaborating with the team, Kim leverages AWS frameworks to monitor costs and incorporates validation mechanisms into the pipelines to manage the resources being created.

Proper CI/CD implementation, monitoring, and management of cloud resources are critical to the stable operation of business systems.

润色建议：
	•	将”云上资源的合理的CICD、监控，管理”翻译为“Proper CI/CD implementation, monitoring, and management of cloud resources”以确保语句更流畅。
	•	在描述Kim的工作时，加入“leverages AWS frameworks”显得更专业，强调了使用AWS现有工具的能力。
	•	整体保持简洁，同时突出了核心要点：基础设施建设、CI/CD、成本监控和资源管理。
